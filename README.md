## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm)
* **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn**

### Installation

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd your-crop-doctor-app
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses the following key dependencies for its functionality:
    * `react` and `react-dom` for the user interface.
    * `@supabase/supabase-js` for database and storage interactions.
    * `@google/generative-ai` for integrating with the Gemini AI model.

    ```

### Supabase Setup

1.  **Create a Supabase Project:**
    * Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Set up Storage Bucket:**
    * In your Supabase project, navigate to "Storage".
    * Create a new bucket named `crop-pictures`.
    * Set its security policy to `Public` for easy access in this demo (for production, implement Row Level Security and authentication).
3.  **Set up Database Table:**
    * Navigate to "Table Editor".
    * Create a new table named `crop_images` with the following columns:
        * `id`: `uuid` (Primary Key, Default Value: `gen_random_uuid()`)
        * `created_at`: `timestampz` (Default Value: `now()`)
        * `image_url`: `text`
        * `file_name`: `text`
        * `disease_name`: `text` (nullable)
        * `cure_instructions`: `text` (nullable)
        * `next_steps_if_not_curable`: `text` (nullable)
        * `ai_analysis_completed`: `boolean` (Default Value: `false`)
        * `ai_error_message`: `text` (nullable)
        * `user_id`: `uuid` (Optional: if you plan to implement user authentication later)
4.  **Get Supabase Credentials:**
    * Go to "Project Settings" -> "API".
    * Copy your `Project URL` and `anon public` key.

### Google Gemini API Key

1.  **Get a Google Gemini API Key:**
    * Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to generate an API key.
